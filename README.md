# Atom-postcss-sorting-config

## Installation
- Install the plugin
<code> $ apm install postcss-sorting
- Download the .json file
- place the .json file in your home folder
- goto your atom settings and search the plugin
- look for the custom config input
- path to your config file is ~/.postcss-sorting.json
- that's all :sunglasses:

## usage
- open messy scss file
- use the command <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>
- or use <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and type "postcss sorting: run"
- you can enable "on save" but some mixin go broke after that!
